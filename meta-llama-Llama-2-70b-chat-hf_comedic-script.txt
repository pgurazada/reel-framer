  [Scene opens with Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna standing in front of a sleek, futuristic lab bench, wearing lab coats and goggles. They're surrounded by various scientific instruments and machines, with a large screen displaying a DNA sequence in the background.]

Emmanuelle: "Alright, Jen, we've got our CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors, and our plan to eradicate sickle cell disease. We're like the ultimate gene therapy superheroes!"

Jennifer: "That's right, Emmanuelle! We're the Avengers of gene therapy! But instead of Iron Man and Captain America, we've got CRISPR/Cas9 and a plan to save the world!"

[Enter Debojyoti Chakraborty, lead scientist of the gene therapy project at CSIR-IGIB, wearing a lab coat and goggles, looking determined.]

Debojyoti: "Not so fast, ladies! India's got its own gene therapy project, and we're hot on your heels! We're talking about the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission, and our goal is to eliminate the disease by 2047!"

Emmanuelle: "Oh, it's on now! It's like a gene therapy showdown between the US and India, with sickle cell disease as the ultimate prize!"

Jennifer: "Bring it on, Debojyoti! We've got Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics on our side, and our Casgevy therapy is already approved! It's like a one-time, single-dose infusion of pure gene therapy goodness!"

Debojyoti: "Well, we've got Bluebird Bio and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, and the department of science and technology on our side. And our Lyfgenia therapy is right on its heels!"

[Scene cuts to a group of scientists working in a lab, busily typing away at their computers, with various scientific instruments and machines beeping and whirring in the background.]

Scientist 1: "We're making great progress on the gene therapy front, Debojyoti! The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is revolutionizing the field!"

Scientist 2: "And with the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission, we're on track to eliminate the disease in India by 2047!"

[Scene cuts back to Emmanuelle and Jennifer, looking determined and heroic.]

Emmanuelle: "We're not going down without a fight, Debojyoti! We're the ultimate gene therapy superheroes, and we're here to save the world, one CRISPR snip at a time!"

Jennifer: "That's right, Emmanuelle! It's like a gene therapy battle royale, and we're the champions! Stay tuned for the next episode of 'Gene Therapy: The Battle for Sickle Cell'!"

[Scene ends with the three scientists standing in front of their respective labs, looking determined and ready to take on the challenge, as the camera zooms out to reveal the two labs, one in the US and one in India, with the words "Gene Therapy: The Battle for Sickle Cell" displayed on the screen.]

Punchline: "It's not just about saving the world, it's about saving the world, one gene at a time!"
