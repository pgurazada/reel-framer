 (Setting: The USFDA headquarters. The USFDA is standing in the center, surrounded by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, Bluebird Bio, and Debojyoti Chakraborty from CSIR-IGIB.)

USFDA: (pumping fists) "We just approved two game-changing gene therapies for SCD! Casgevy and Lyfgenia!"

Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics: (high-fiving) "Our Casgevy uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the Nobel Prize-winning tech!"

Bluebird Bio: (clapping) "We're still in the game with Lyfgenia, giving patients a choice!"

Debojyoti Chakraborty: (smiling) "Back in India, we've been working on our own CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy for SCD since 2018. We're in the preclinical stage, but just wait for our big entrance!"

USFDA: (laughs) "We can't wait to see what you all bring to the table! Keep up the good work, team!"
