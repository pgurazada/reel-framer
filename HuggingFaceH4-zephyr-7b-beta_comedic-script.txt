(Scene opens with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics dressed in superhero costumes, standing in front of the USFDA building. USFDA, dressed in a cape and mask, enters.)

USFDA: "Who dares to challenge the mighty FDA? Step forward, superheroes of the gene therapy world!"

Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics: "It's us, USFDA! We've got our breakthrough treatment Casgevy, and we're here to save the day for sickle cell disease patients aged 12 and over!"

USFDA: "Impressive! But have you considered the side effects? Will your patients turn into superheroes too?"

Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics: "No, USFDA! Our patients will just have healthier blood cells. But we do promise they'll have superhero-level courage to face their sickle cell disease!"

USFDA: "Very well! I grant my approval for Casgevy. But beware, superheroes! There's a new player in town - Bluebird Bio's Lyfgenia! They're also approved for sickle cell disease patients aged 12 and over!"

Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics: "Oh no! We'll have to team up and fight crime together! But first, let's celebrate with some superhero-strength protein shakes!"

(They all high-five and exit, leaving the audience laughing.)

(End of skit.)
