[Scene opens with two chefs, VERTEX and CRISPR, in a high-tech kitchen. They are wearing lab coats and aprons with the logos of their respective companies. The kitchen is equipped with advanced machinery and screens displaying genetic sequences.]

VERTEX: (excitedly) CRISPR, did you hear the news? Our gene therapies for sickle cell disease have been approved by the USFDA!

CRISPR: (grinning) Yes, I heard! This is a game-changer for patients over 12. Our breakthrough gene therapies use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to modify their own blood stem cells during a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

VERTEX: (smiling) It's like we're cooking up a delicious new dish for these patients. Our gene therapies will whip up their sickled cells into healthy, round ones.

CRISPR: (laughing) Exactly! And the best part is, our gene therapies will be part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which will replace the patient's diseased stem cells with healthy ones.

VERTEX: (raising an imaginary spoon) This is a recipe for success! Our gene therapies will help patients breathe easier and live longer, without the need for frequent blood transfusions.

CRISPR: (nodding) Yes, and our breakthroughs will also help in the elimination of sickle cell disease in India, as scientists associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) have been working on gene therapy for SCD since 2018, using the same technology.

VERTEX: (surprised) Wow, that's amazing! It's like we're both cooking up a storm for sickle cell disease patients worldwide.

CRISPR: (grinning) Indeed! And the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission in India, launched this year, targets to eliminate sickle cell disease by 2047. 

VERTEX: (raising his lab coat) Let's cook up a cure for sickle cell disease, and serve it to patients around the world!

CRISPR: (laughing) Absolutely! Our gene therapies will make a significant contribution to the elimination of sickle cell disease, one patient at a time.

[The scene ends with the two chefs high-fiving each other and looking content as the audience applauds.]
