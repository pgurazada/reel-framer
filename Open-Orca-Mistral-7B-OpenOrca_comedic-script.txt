Scene: The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved two gene therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients 12 years and older.

Casgevy: Hey Lyfgenia, you know what's awesome? The USFDA just approved our gene therapies for SCD!

Lyfgenia: That's fantastic, Casgevy! Our combined powers make us the perfect sickle cell-fighting duo!

Dr. Vertex: Indeed, Casgevy and Lyfgenia's therapies are a breakthrough. They use CRISPR/Cas9 and Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna's discoveries.

Dr. Bluebird: That's right! Both therapies involve modifying patients' blood stem cells and giving them back as a one-time infusion.

Casgevy: And we're not the only ones! Debojyoti Chakraborty and his team at CSIR-IGIB are working on a similar therapy.

Lyfgenia: That's great! The more superheroes, the better!

Emmanuelle Charpentier: Thank you, Casgevy and Lyfgenia. Your work is inspiring, and we're honored to be part of your team.

Jennifer Doudna: Absolutely! We're excited to see the impact your therapies will have on sickle cell patients.

Casgevy and Lyfgenia: Thank you, Emmanuelle and Jennifer! Let's keep fighting the good fight!

(End with a punchline:)

Casgevy: And who knows, maybe one day we'll have a whole team of sickle cell-fighting superheroes!
